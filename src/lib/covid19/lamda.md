## **Variant:** Lamda 

#### Origin:

First samples of the Lambda variant were detected in Peru in August 2020 and by April 2021, over eighty percent of new cases of COVID-19 in Peru were from the new variant.

#### Symptoms:

At present, there is nothing to suggest that the symptoms of infection with the new C.37, or Lambda, variant are different to other coronavirus strains.

#### Effect toward Vaccine:

Researchers found that Mrna vaccines are effective with Lambda variant. Both the Pfizer and the Moderna coronavirus vaccines used in the UK are mRNA jabs, meaning they contain genetic material that instructs the bodyâ€™s cells to produce coronavirus spikes, which then provokes an immune response.
The results of this paper suggest that vaccines in current use will remain protective against the Lambda variant.
